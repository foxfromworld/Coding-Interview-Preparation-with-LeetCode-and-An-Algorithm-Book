<h4>3-3.</h4> 

(a) Consider an underflow strategy that cuts the array size in half whenever the array falls below half full. Give an example sequence of insertions and deletions where this strategy gives a bad amortized cost.

--> When cutting the array size in half can never happen. Ex: size 4 array with 3 elements. Remove 1, insert 1, and so on.

(b) Then, give a better underflow strategy than that suggested above, one that achieves constant amortized cost per deletion. 

--> Ex: when the size 4 array is one-fourth full, cut its size in half, and so on.
