<h3>Finding Counterexamples</h3>

<h4>1-1. Show that a + b can be less than min(a, b). </h4>



1-2. Show that a × b can be less than min(a, b).

1-3. Design/draw a road network with two points a and b such that the fastest route between a and b is not the shortest route.

1-4. Design/draw a road network with two points a and b such that the shortest route between a and b is not the route with the fewest turns.

1-5. The knapsack problem is as follows: given a set of integers S = {s1, s2,...,sn}, and a target number T, find a subset of S which adds up exactly to T. For example, there exists a subset within S = {1, 2, 5, 9, 10} that adds up to T = 22 but not
T = 23. Find counterexamples to each of the following algorithms for the knapsack problem. That is, giving an S and T such that the subset is selected using the algorithm does not leave the knapsack completely full, even though such a solution exists.

　　　(a) Put the elements of S in the knapsack in left to right order if they fit, i.e. the first-fit algorithm.
  　　(b) Put the elements of S in the knapsack from smallest to largest, i.e. the best-fit algorithm.
　　　(c) Put the elements of S in the knapsack from largest to smallest.
