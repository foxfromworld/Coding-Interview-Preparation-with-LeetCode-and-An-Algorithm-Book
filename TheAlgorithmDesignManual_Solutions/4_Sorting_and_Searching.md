<h3>Applications of Sorting</h3>

<h4>4-1.</h4> 

For example, use merge sort and split the list in halves.

<h4>4-2.</h4> 

(a) Go through the list and find the max and min at the same time. At the end, get the value of |max-min|.

(b) Find the difference of the first and the last element.

(c) For example, sort the list using heap sort and check the difference by going through the list to find the min value with. 

(d) Use the (c) method (without sorting), the time complexity becomes O(n).

<h4>4-3.</h4> 

Sort the list with quicksort. And get the last and the first as a pair. Contiune this operation until it becomes a list of n pairs.

<h4>4-4.</h4> 

Go through the list and take red, blue, yellow items out, then put them into respective buckets. Lastly, append those items back together following the sequence: red, blue, yellow.

<h4>4-5.</h4> 

1. Sort the list with O(nlogn) sorting algorithm and go through the list to find the mode.

2. Use the dictionary to count.
